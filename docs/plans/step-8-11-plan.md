# Steps 8-11 Plan: Visualization Components

## Objective
Build tree visualization with layout algorithm, node cards, SVG connectors.

## Tasks
- [ ] Step 8: Tree layout algorithm in utils/layout.ts
- [ ] Step 9: PlanNode component for node cards
- [ ] Step 10: Connectors component for SVG lines
- [ ] Step 11: PlanTree component combining all

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Layout algorithm positions nodes correctly
- [ ] Nodes display operation, object, rows, cost
- [ ] Warnings highlighted with colors
- [ ] Connectors draw smooth curves
- [ ] Tree is scrollable
- [ ] Node selection works
- [ ] Tests pass, typecheck passes
